## Project Overview üåü

The main objectives of **EstateInsights** are to:

1. **Predict Property Prices**:
   - Users can input various features such as property type, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other amenities. The application utilizes a trained machine learning model to estimate the price range of the specified property.

2. **Visualize Market Trends**:
   - The application includes interactive visualizations that display essential market trends. Users can explore scatter plots, pie charts, and geographical heatmaps to understand price distributions and sector performance.

3. **Recommend Apartments**:
   - Based on user preferences and selected properties, the application provides recommendations for similar apartments. This feature helps users find options that match their requirements while considering amenities, price, and location.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **User Inputs**: The application allows users to select various inputs such as property type, sector, age, built-up area, and more, facilitating accurate price predictions.
  
- **Dynamic Data Visualization**: Users can view interactive maps and charts that illustrate property prices per square foot, feature distributions, and market comparisons.

- **Word Clouds**: The application generates word clouds that represent the most common facilities available in different sectors, providing users with a quick overview of amenities.

- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Users can analyze property features against price, visualize distributions, and compare BHK (Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen) configurations through various plots and charts.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Streamlit**: Used to build the interactive web application.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Plotly and Matplotlib**: For data visualization and charting.
- **WordCloud**: To generate visual representations of common features.

## How It Works üîç

1. **Input Stage**: Users fill out a form with property details, which are then processed to create a DataFrame for the prediction model.

2. **Prediction Stage**: The application uses a pre-trained machine learning pipeline to estimate the property price, providing a price range based on input features.

3. **Visualization Stage**: Users can navigate through various sections to explore interactive charts and maps, gaining insights into the real estate market.

4. **Recommendation Stage**: Based on the selected property, the application suggests similar listings, allowing users to discover new options that meet their needs.
